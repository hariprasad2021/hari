<center><u><h1 style = "color:gold;">MYSORE PALACE</h1></u></center>
<h2><u>Introduction</u></h2>
<h3 style = "color:white">The architect of the famed heritage was Henry Irwin who primarily covered the palace with seven expansive arches. The central arc has an exquisitely sculpted image of Gajalakshmi, the goddess of wealth and prosperity.

The palace is a kaleidoscope of painted glass and mirrors that capture the beauty of the various paintings hung around the palace and reflect them across the hallways and corridors. Also, exotic mahogany gates and doors with intricate carvings along walls and chandeliers of Czechoslovakian make for a perfect visual treat.</h3>
<h2 style="color:black"><u>Architecture and design</u></h2>
<h3 style = "color:white">An incredibly breathtaking example of Indo - Saracenic style of architecture, the Mysore Palace is a magnificent edifice located in Mysore in the state of Karnataka. Also known as the Amba Vilas Palace, it is the former palace of the royal family of Mysore and is still their official residence. Mysore Palace was built in the year 1912 for the 24th Ruler of the Wodeyar Dynasty and is counted amongst one of the biggest palaces in the country</h3>

<h2 style="color:black"><u>Construction</u></h2>
<h3 style="color:white">The last palace, now known as the Old Palace or the Wooden Palace, burned to ashes during the 1896 marriage event (Dasara festivities). Maharaja Krishnaraja Wodeyar IV and his mother Maharani Kempananjammanni Devi commissioned the British architect Henry Irwin to build a new palace.[2] Meanwhile, the royal family stayed in the nearby Jaganmohan Palace. Construction was overseen by an executive engineer in the Mysore Palace division. He conducted elaborate architectural studies during his visits to Delhi, Madras, and Calcutta, and these were used to plan the new palace. The construction cost was placed at Rs 41,47,913 (around $30 million adjusted to inflation) and the palace was completed in 1912.[3][4]

The palace was further expanded in around 1930 (including the addition of the present Public Durbar Hall wing) during the reign of Maharaja Jayachamarajendra Wadiyar. Although the construction was completed in 1912, the fort continued to be beautified and its inhabitants were slowly moved to newer extensions built off the palace.[citation needed]</h3>
